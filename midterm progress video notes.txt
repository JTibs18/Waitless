Progress 
- full stack is connected and functional for 1/3 views 
- learn angular and typescript through online courses 
- figma has really helped in implementation so far 

Snags/Complications: 
- becoming comfortable in angular/typescript took more time than expected which has slowed down development. 
Some major difficulties in angular thus far were: 
	- Learning how to create components and use components within components
	- Connecting Angular front end to node/express and mongo in the back end (Running front end and back end servers) 
		-routing with angular and express 

Some future challenges in angular will be: 
	- uploading images to the application 
	- creating user authentication 

Important features that need to be implemented: 
	- Restaurant dashboard 
	- Patron view (mobile) 
	- Connecting client's (patron and restaurant dashboard) via websockets 
	- Writing a NLP algorithm to identify allergens with labels given a list of ingredients
