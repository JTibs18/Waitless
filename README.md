# Waitless
Honours Project 2021

<h1> Overview <h1> 
The proposed project, WAITLESS, is an endeavor to create an interactive online menu where
restaurants can upload their menu to the application, specifying ingredients within each dish.
Diners will be able to scan a QR code to load the restaurant’s menu, enter their dietary
restrictions and receive recommendations for safe food and drinks to order. Ordering will be
completed through the menu web application so that the restaurant chefs are able to receive
orders digitally through the application’s restaurant dashboard thereby eliminating the
inevitable delay between receiving a menu and ordering food items.

<h1> Main Objectives <h1>
The main objective of this project is to develop a MEAN full stack web application that
restaurants can easily adopt and implement as an efficient social distancing solution to slow
and disorganized in person ordering processes. Additionally, WAITLESS menu will eliminate the
ambiguity of meal ingredients so that those with dietary restrictions can instantly and clearly
identify which dishes are safe.
